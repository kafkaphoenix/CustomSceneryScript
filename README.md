# CustomSceneryScript
Python Script to generate a CustomScenery folder for FS2020

You need to have SimpleScenery in the same folder than the script
Disclaimer: You still need to export the blender project and go to 
<project_folder>\PackageSources\modelLib\<Project_name>Model\<project_name>.xml
to change XML version number to '1.1' and add 'encoding="utf-8"
For help about how to this go to https://github.com/TheBeardedNorwichian/3DMtoMSFS to the section
Import capture into Blender, tidy up, and export
